## wireframing

###  What is Wireframing?
**Wireframing** is the process of creating a visual blueprint or skeletal layout of a user interface (UI).  
It focuses on structure, content placement, and navigation flow — without worrying about colors, images, or detailed design elements.  
Wireframes act as the *foundation* of a digital product’s design, outlining how users will interact with the system.

###  Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- **Clarifies Structure:** Helps designers and developers visualize the layout and hierarchy of elements before full design begins.  
- **Enhances Collaboration:** Serves as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders to align on the product’s flow and functionality.  
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Identifies usability issues early, reducing the need for expensive design or development changes later.  
- **Guides User Experience (UX):** Ensures that user journeys are smooth, logical, and efficient before adding visual styling.
